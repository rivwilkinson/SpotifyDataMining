# SpotifyDataMining
I am currently working on a project to mine my Spotify streaming history data using R programming language. The data is in JSON format and contains 21 variables and 16,693 observations, with columns for various information such as the song/episode name, the artist, album, play time, platform used, and more. I have used several R libraries such as jsonlite, tidyverse, and data.table to perform data cleaning and preparation tasks such as removing irrelevant columns, splitting columns into separate ones, updating data types, and adding new columns.

I have also created some visualizations to explore the data such as histograms of milliseconds played, bar charts of reasons why songs started, and bar charts of number of songs played by day of the week. While I have not yet implemented any machine learning techniques, my ultimate goal is to use machine learning to gain deeper insights and patterns from my Spotify streaming history data.
